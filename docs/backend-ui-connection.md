To connect the frontend (React app) with the backend (Python scripts), the backend exposes API endpoints using Flask. The frontend sends HTTP requests to these endpoints to fetch and display data, such as live prices from a prices.json file and results from terminal input.

In the backend, a Flask server is set up with two primary routes: one (/api/prices) serves the pricing data from prices.json, and another (/api/execute) handles POST requests to run a Python script (ui_input.py) with the terminal input provided by the user. The frontend (React) makes HTTP requests to these endpoints using Axios to fetch the pricing data and send commands to be processed by the backend. The results are then displayed in the UI, including real-time prices and any outputs from the terminal input.
